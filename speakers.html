A dictator can shut off the internet with the flick of a switch. Is that right? Do people have a right to communicate? And, do we have the technology to uphold that right?</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfh3Bm0x6Qs">Watch Andrew's Talk »</a></div><div class="speaker-card" id="stavros-michailidis"><img class="inline-image" src="/images/stavros.jpg" alt="Photo of Stavros Michailidis"><h2>Stavros Michailidis</h2><p>An expert in creativity and innovation, Stavros empowers organizational innovation.</p><h3>Building Momentum for Great Ideas</h3><p>Is there an invisible element at play that's determining the fate of our projects and initiatives? What if we could become aware of that element, understand it, measure it, and affect it? Would we ever look at creativity, innovation, and leadership the same again?</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYF5_tIjQRw">Watch Stavros's Talk »</a></div><div class="speaker-card" id="andy-burnett"><img class="inline-image" src="/images/andy.jpg" alt="Photo of Andy Burnett"><h2>Andy Burnett</h2><p>Creativity consultant with a passion for technology</p><h3>Frictionless Creativity</h3><p>If you could build your ideal creative space, what would it look like? Most of us don't have the chance to build a truly personalised 'ideas lab', but the growth of computing power, coupled with the internet, means that this is about to change.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVzx5-mI89Q">Watch Andy's Talk »</a></div><div class="speaker-card" id="jean-tang"><img class="inline-image" src="/images/jean.jpg" alt="Photo of Jean Tang"><h2>Jean Tang</h2><p>In 2007, Jean Tang saw the need for a 2.6-second website: bite-sized, seductive, and jargon-free. The lawyer-turned-journalist brought on other talented writers to help-and created MarketSmiths, which offers business &quot;copywriting for humans&quot; in every subject, every voice, and every format.</p><h3>Declaring War on Bland: Copywriting as Fresh Literature</h3><p>Classic literature had it right from the start. For centuries, it told stories in voices captivating enough to get read, studied, quoted...and revered. Today, great writing still has the power to move. But it's become rare, and-ironically-devalued. How do we raise its worth, and give it the potential to impact and enhance each of our lives, every single day?</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcBHk4UVa8g">Watch Jean's Talk »</a></div><div class="speaker-card" id="khaled-dajani"><img class="inline-image" src="/images/khaled.jpg" alt="Photo of Khaled Dajani and Kelley Donovan &amp; Dancers"><h2>Khaled Dajani and Kelley Donovan &amp; Dancers</h2><p>Khaled's music is the definition of East meets West. The singer/guitarist fuses different musical genres from the Middle East, the Mediterranean and the Americas into soulful arrangements and intricate rhythms. Kelley Donovan splits her time between Boston and New York City, teaching in both cities and has performed work by Ann Carlson and Liz Lerman. She received her training in choreography from Mark Morris and Bessie Schonberg, and has shown work in Boston and at the Cunningham Studio, Joyce SoHo, Movement Research, The Rover and the 92nd St. Y.</p><h3>Motion of the Dancers</h3><p>Kelley Donovan and Dancers dance to Khaled's Motion of the Dancers, an instrumental piece written to describe an intense sensual relationship which is about to take place. The music describes the chase or dance that occurs between two lovers upon their first connection and the journey that connection endures. The ups and downs detail the struggles and victories of the chase resulting in a climax leaving the lovers breathless.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEF2tcsRV6E">Watch Khaled's Talk »</a></div><div class="speaker-card" id="marshall-bergmann"><img class="inline-image" src="/images/marshall.jpg" alt="Photo of Marshall Bergmann"><h2>Marshall Bergmann</h2><p>Marshall uses simulations and games to accelerate corporate strategy and change behavior.</p><h3>The Hidden Power of Games</h3><p>Organizations are beginning to recognize that games can be an effective tool to drive sales, and increase customer loyalty and satisfaction. As corporations become more comfortable with the concept of using games as a sales and marketing vehicle the next logical step is to turn the focus inward and begin to use games to change employee behavior to build alignment and engagement. This talk will provide insights into how leading global organizations are using games to change employee behavior and achieve results.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ecQDX1XOw">Watch Marshall's Talk »</a></div><div class="speaker-card" id="sophy-bot"><img class="inline-image" src="/images/sophy.jpg" alt="Photo of Sophy Bot"><h2>Sophy Bot</h2><p>Sophy Bot has a knack for seamlessly transitioning from artist to consultant and back again, blending elements of the two to foster greater innovation.

But sloppy security gives those with malicious intent easy access.  Who are they? What are they after? And what if we could build computers that would defend you by design?</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q4259dVfxc">Watch Simon's Talk »</a></div><div class="speaker-card" id="jim-holm"><img class="inline-image" src="/images/jim.jpg" alt="Photo of Jim Holm"><h2>Jim Holm</h2><p>Co-Founder of the Clean Oceans Project.</p><h3>The Clean Oceans Project</h3><p>There is an estimate 97 million pounds of plastic in the Pacific Ocean.
