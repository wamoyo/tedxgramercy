She's been an actor in theater and film as far as China and close as 14th Street. In a moment of achievement at the peak of her acting career she made a decision to leave her career as an actor behind; a decision that has played out as a shift from telling stories of fiction, to cultivating true stories about real people, real struggles, and the impact they have.</p><blockquote>I continue to be joyfully surprised by how fulfilling this work is. Speaking is an artform, and TEDx is where we discover new and powerful ideas.</blockquote><p>Since parting from being an actor full time, Kelsey has produced events at the United Nations in New York, coached speakers and taught communication skills, and built some incredible networks and education programs. She has found an entirely new passion in helping people to express themselves fully and skillfully.</p><h3>Costa Michailidis</h3><p>Costa is.... how to say this best...? A creative misfit.</p><p>In his early years, try as he might, Costa never fit in. Getting fired from jobs, or quitting on ethical grounds, eventually he turned to entrepreneurship and succeeded in building an innovation consulting practice. It turns out change is useful and valuable, just not when it comes spontaneously from those entry level positions he occupied so briefly.</p><p>Costa has been organizing TEDx events since 2012, participated in the first TEDx Organizer's summit in Doha, and was on the team that brought the first TEDx event to the United Nations in New York along with Kelsey.</p><blockquote>TEDx has been an adventure. I've met people who've walked across Antartica and sent robots to Mars. I've laughed and cried, and explored notions about the world and about myself. It's a community I've grown to treasure very much, and can't wait to see what we shake up next.</blockquote><p>In his day job he works mostly with scientists at NASA and the National Science Foundation, helping to accelerate innovation efforts in science.</p><p>You'll find yourself laughing at his antics, and thinking deeply at the questions he poses.</p></section><!--hr.hr--><section class="max-1366"><h2>About TEDx, x = independently organized event</h2><p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p><h2>About TED</h2><p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.</p><p>The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</p><p>Follow TED on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/TEDTalks">http://twitter.com/TEDTalks</a>, or on Facebook at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TED">http://www.facebook.com/TED</a>.</p></section><hr class="hr space-top"><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-social-links"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TEDxGramercy" title="Find us on Facebook!"> <img src="/images/facebook.svg" alt="Facebook"></a><a href="https://www.twitter.com/TEDxGramercy" title="Follow us on Twitter!"> <img src="/images/twitter.svg" alt="Twitter"></a><a href="http://eepurl.com/T2115" title="Sign up for our Newsletter!"> <img src="/images/email.svg" alt="Email"></a></div><a href="/terms" id="terms-link">Terms &amp; Conditions</a></footer><script src="/scripts/hamburger-accessibility.js"></script><script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script></body></html>
